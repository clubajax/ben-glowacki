    </p><p>Sun Prairie resident Matt Glowacki (pronounced “Glow-Walk-E”) knows how to have fun. And as someone who was born without legs, he knows all about overcoming obstacles, even if those obstacles are just overcoming other people’s perceptions. For two decades, Glowacki has made his living by speaking with other people – primarily college-age students – about diversity.</p>
<p>Although he started out as what most people would call a motivational speaker, Glowacki said he has moved away from that title.</p>
<p>“In my mind, I stopped being a motivational speaker a few years ago, and I became a guy with some really cool stories and some neat ideas,” he explained.</p><p>He still addresses the fact he was born without legs in his program, but he said that usually gets discussed in the first five minutes, and from there the “program goes in weird or fun directions.”</p><p>From the moment college students walk in the doors at one of Glowacki’s presentations, they are welcomed into an interactive environment. As students come in, Glowacki plays music and has a slideshow of trivia, video clips, funny photos and facts about diversity.</p><p>“The idea is to try and establish an urgency in their mind to try and get more information and maybe tip their interest level, so by the time I get on stage, they are already thinking a little bit about diversity and they know this is probably not going to be the kind of program they’ve experienced before.”</p><p>Glowacki offers two programs that address the topic of diversity: Walking is Over-Rated and Diversity According to Family Guy and South Park.</p><p>One topic Glowacki addresses in Walking is Over-Rated is how people with disabilities are treated differently. Even though Glowacki was born without legs, he would not say he had a tough life.</p><p>“There are a lot of people walking around with way bigger problems than me not having any legs. So when people say I’m a motivation, really I think it is coming from maybe an absence of information on their part about the quality of my life,” he said.</p><p>Diversity According to Family Guy and South Park covers three different diversity topics –  disabilities, lookism and racism – and incorporates clips from the shows into the presentation.</p><p>“The lookism component is discrimination against people based on the way they look, but unfortunately we do it to ourselves because very few people conform to the societal standard of beauty,” Glowacki said. “We end up discriminating against ourself. So what I do in that argument is construct an idea that unfortunately with all of the media images of what perfect bodies look like, and body mass and Barbie dolls and Bratz dolls, we talk about how those are basically programming us to feel bad about ourselves and so we spend more money on things that are supposed to solve our problems.”</p><p>Glowacki also talks about hidden disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], and what happens when a person discloses his or her disability. Glowacki said 50 percent of veterans coming home are coming back with a disability, and it is not necessarily a prosthetic limb.</p><p>“It is harder for a person with a hidden disability to self-disclose the nature of their disability to someone than it is for me because I am a person who has an obvious disability, no legs. People go ‘Oh my gosh, he doesn’t have any legs, I wonder what other things he can’t do.’ Then when I come in and prove to them I am a proficient person, capable of doing things, the expectation goes from low to high.</p><p>“When somebody comes in with a hidden disability and then self-disclose they have a disability, what happens is people’s expectations go from 100 percent to 60 percent, and it is a lot harder to earn that 40 percent back,” Glowacki added. “…It is a lot harder for a veteran or a person with a hidden disability to acclimate into society than it is for a person with an outright or physical disability.”</p><p>When confronting racism, Glowacki talks about how to have that hard conversation when a friend says something inappropriate.</p><p>“Evil does exist in the world and it exists when someone who is close to you says or does something bad and lashed out to another person, and you don’t try and make that correction,” Glowacki said.</p><p>Unlike with strangers, the emotional connection between friends makes it more likely your message will make it through.</p><p>“If we are friends and respect each other, trust each other, and I would see you or you would see me do something terribly wrong that would tear down another person, well at that point if you disagreed with what I’d said, I am asking people in the audience to actually try and have that conversation with their friends to try and change a lot of the hate speech and the terrible things people do to other people, not thinking that they are actually doing real damage,” Glowacki explained. “So many times people want to say something, they want to try and do something, but they don’t know how to have that conversation, so we train people on how to do that.</p><p>“That is Diversity According to Family Guy and South Park, all wrapped around clips from the show…We teach people the real reason the shows are funny…the real ideas on why the shows are good shows, and it has everything to do with the messages behind the shows,” he added.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don’t worry, be happy</strong></p><p>“Happiness is a journey, not a destination.” - Souza</p><p>The last program Glowacki offers is called Doing Happiness, and was originally dreamed up two years ago by his wife, Shannon. One of the best ways to be happy is to do for others, Glowacki said. The public speaker put practice to action when he came in for his interview on May 17, armed with a happiness first-aid kit.</p><p>Smiley faces decorate the outside of the yellow paper bag, while inside the bag are three items that will bring a smile to someone’s face.</p><p>The first item: jelly beans. But these were not your everyday jelly beans. These jelly beans came with a message, a reminder to be happy with yourself.</p><p>The jelly beans Glowacki packs in some of his happiness first-aid kits are the Jelly Belly jelly beans that look just a little different, the ones the factories cannot sell.</p><p>“We give them away as a metaphor to people in the audience. Just because they don’t look perfect, they can still be good, like people,” Glowacki said.</p><p>At this point, Glowacki started explaining about what he calls his Best Most Favorites – things that are so amazing, or delicious, or exhilarating – they are the best you’ve ever had or experienced. It is those things, Glowacki said, people should write down so they remember the initial experience. Or share the experience with someone else.</p><p>Because he travels so much, Glowacki carries a Best Most Favorite notebook with him, and when he finds something he likes, he writes it down so Shannon and he can go back and experience it together. One of Glowacki’s Best Most Favorites came about when he disembarked in San Francisco.</p><p>As he tells it, there are a number of candy and chocolate kiosks in the airport. One of the vendors asked Glowacki if he liked chocolate, specifically dark chocolate. It was then that Glowacki discovered Ghirardelli’s sea salt caramel dark chocolate. He loved it so much that he decided to include it in his happiness first-aid kit.</p><p>The third item in the bag epitomizes the fun-filled nature Glowacki brings to all of his presentations. While the jelly beans and chocolate taste delicious, the third item – a bubble wand and soap – nurture the spirit.</p><p>At the same time the interview room was filling with bubbles, it was also filling with smiles from those present.</p><p>“More, more, more, come on, you can do it,” Glowacki encouraged.</p><p>“The reason blowing bubbles makes people happy is when you blow bubbles, first of all you see them, and they are beautiful, and that makes you smile,” he continued. “The other neat thing about bubbles is when you blow them it takes you back to an earlier part of your childhood, when things were a little bit easier.”</p><p>The reason Glowacki includes three items in his first-aid kit?</p><p>“It takes three positive things to make up for one negative thing that happens to you in your life,” Glowacki explained. “So if something ever is kind of not going your way and you want to feel better, eat a little bit of chocolate, talk about some jelly beans and blow some bubbles, and it will make your day better.”</p><p>Another thing Glowacki teaches his audiences is how to hug. There is more to it than just wrapping your arms around another human being, he explains. For a hug to be real, you must hold it for at least six seconds.</p><p>The reason you must hold it that long, he said, is because it takes six seconds for the brain to register the hug and release mood-boosting chemicals.</p><p>“It tingles at four and is real at six,” Glowacki said.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diversity Artist of the Year</strong></p><p>Glowacki has been traveling and talking to audiences across the United States for 20 years. No matter where he goes, he usually bumps into someone who recognizes him.</p><p>The same people who have heard him speak would recommend him to others.</p><p>In 2010, Glowacki won Campus Activities Magazine’s Best Diversity Artist. Voting for the award is done by college students and university personnel across the United States. At the time, the same person could not win the award two years in a row, but when Glowacki was eligible again in 2012, he was one of the top contestants again and was voted First Runner Up.</p><p>This year Glowacki was once again named Best Diversity Artist, an award his wife, Shannon, referred to as “the Academy Award of campus speaking.”</p><p>“In the category of diversity, this is it, so it is kind of neat,” Glowacki added.</p><p>His popularity and fun programs have made him the most booked speaker in America, with anywhere from 100-200 programs a year across the United States.</p><p>To learn more about Glowacki or his programs, or to book him for a presentation, visit <a href="http://www.mattglowacki.com/">www.mattglowacki.com</a>.</p>
